Goal of code:
    Take hashed password in argv

        identify salt

            first 2 chars of provided hash

        place salt in crypt.crypt function

        brute force password

            search every combination of upper and lowercase letters
            in the plaintext portion of crypt.crypt

                by having an empty 5 char string

                    sequentially fill every position in that string
                    with every possible letter

                        place string in crypt func

                            until hashed password equals provided hash

    print the plaintext that is associated with hash
