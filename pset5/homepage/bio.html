        <div id="txt" class="text-justify">
            <p>
                My life... is not very notable. I grew up in Lebanon in an environment seeped in a not-so-insignificant level of atmospheric existential dread... Good times.
            </p>
            <p>
                But in all honesty I've lived a very privilaged life. I have been very lucky to be afforded the opportunities to thrive throughout my life-time. I can't say with full confidence that I'm living my life to the fullest; but maybe one day I can.
            </p>

                Stay fresh, Cheese Bags.
